# Hi, I'm Claudio!

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI)](https://www.polimi.it/en/), with a strong interest in embedded systems and heterogeneous systems. I love working on projects that involve hardware and software integration, and I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge in these areas.
